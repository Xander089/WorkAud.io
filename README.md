# WorkAud.io

Workaudio is a fitness app that lets you build music playlists for workouts.

Note: 
- the app is built around the Spotify SDK (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/android/)
- users will need a premium Spotify account to use the app

### How does it work?
A user has a certain type of workout they want to do such as "Weightlifting" or "Leg Day" or "Quick Run": the user can set music specific to the workout.

A user can create a workout following these three steps:

- give the workout a name
- set a duration
- add from within the app enough songs to match the workout duration

When a workout starts, an audio player screen appears, with a countdown timer and the current song being played.

Note: the audio player does not allow the user to skip the songs.
